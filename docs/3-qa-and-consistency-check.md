# Prompt: Perform QA, Fix Inconsistencies, and Verify UI

## The Problem
Our documentation has inconsistencies, and we need to verify that the final application meets the specific UI/UX requirements outlined in the `blueprint.md`. This QA pass is essential to ensure the application is consistent, correct, and provides a good user experience.

## The Task
Your goal is to act as a QA engineer and developer to find and fix inconsistencies between our documentation and implementation, and to verify the application's responsiveness and style.

### 1. Resolve Progress Tracking Contradiction
- **Investigation:** Confirm that the application stores all user progress and quiz results in the `quizzes` collection in Firestore, as stated in `architecture.md`.
- **Fix:** Update the `blueprint.md` document. Change the line that says progress is "stored locally in the browser" to reflect that it is stored in Firestore. This ensures our documentation is consistent and accurate.

### 2. Investigate Quiz Generation Scalability
- **Code Review:** Examine the backend or serverless function code responsible for generating quizzes from `flashcard_sets`.
- **Analysis:** Determine if the current implementation for selecting distractor answers is inefficient (e.g., makes excessive database reads for each question). Add comments to the code explaining your findings.
- **Recommendation (Optional):** If the logic is found to be inefficient, create a new ticket or issue outlining a plan to refactor it for better performance, for example, by fetching all possible answers once per quiz and sampling them in memory.

### 3. Perform UI/UX and Responsiveness Verification
- **Device Testing:** Manually test the entire application on the two target screen sizes specified in `blueprint.md`:
    - A desktop browser resized to **720p** (1280x720).
    - An emulated **iPhone SE** (375x667) using browser developer tools.
- **Style Guideline Audit:** Compare the live application against the style guidelines in `blueprint.md`. Check for correct usage of:
    - Primary color (`#64B5F6`)
    - Background color (`#E3F2FD`)
    - Accent color (`#FFB74D`)
    - Font ('PT Sans')
- **Report:** Create a list of any visual bugs, layout issues, or style inconsistencies you find.

### Acceptance Criteria
- The `blueprint.md` file is updated to correctly describe how progress is stored.
- The quiz generation logic has been analyzed and documented with comments.
- A comprehensive report on UI/UX and responsiveness issues has been created, or confirmation is provided that the application meets all guidelines.
